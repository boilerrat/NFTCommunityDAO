### Who we are
We are a group of NFT enthusiasts who first formed while following the renown NFT artist pseudonymously known as Lux Expression. Out of that community came a group interested in expanding the capabilities of their investments were they to pool their resources together.

### How will We Achieve our Goal
First of all, the DAO is set up to run on the Ethereum blockchain, xDAI blockchain and on Polygon. The main focus is on building the Ethereum DAO however the ability to be flexible and take advantage of opportunities as they arise, it is best to be prepared. In addition there is a minion vault summoned and a nifty minion as well. (we will get into minions as the wiki progresses) There is also one other DAO which will not be made active unless required. The system upon which the DAO is summoned is from DAOhaus, who them selves built upon the moloch dao framework developed by the metacartel.

### So How Does the DAO make Money?
Mainly through Investments and NFT sales. There is also the possibility to earn "rent". Every move that the DAO makes is for investments is made democratically and on chain. Meaning all votes are calls to a smart contract, as are proposals. The following are samples for the type of proposals that can be made as investments.

### NFT Sales
The DAO will soon have the ability to accept NFTs as tribute in exchange for shares in the DAO. Essentially the DAO will establish the value of the NFT, through market research (or feeling this is often art afterall) and exchange shares for that NFT also based on the average price paid per share to enter the DAO. The DAO may also buy NFTs on the open market. All the NFTs are stored in the Nifty Minion vault. This vault may also act as a market place or the DAO can interact directly with Rarible.

### NFT Renting and Franchising on the Metaverse
There is a unique opportunity right now in the development of what is known as the metaverse, which is often a 3 dimensional wonderland. On this a user may purchase real estate and actually create virtual buildings, meant to serve many purposes. It is possible for the NFT Community DAO (NFTCD) to purchase virtual real estate and then rent it out for a continued stream of income into the DAO.

With that there is also the possibility to buy things like racetrack, gas stations and billboards; to name a few. These can be rented out for advertising. In the case of gas stations in racing games, if enough are owned, they can be branded and rented out or sold. Or kept and a steady flow of income brought into the DAO in game gas fees.

There is also the possibility of renting out NFTs for people to use in games where having a better NFT will earn better rate of return. With us buying as a group, we would be able to purchase some of the highest yield baring in game items available. So (Unless someone in the DAO wanted to play) you could rent out the NFT for a split of the reward revenue.

### Holding NFTS
With some NFT projects, simply holding the NFT in a wallet pays rewards, often in that projects own token. The NFTCD can simply hold these NFTs in their vault and collect yield for the DAO. It is also possible that holding the NFT can earn yield in other ways, but that does not matter as long as the yield is going back to the DAO.

### Staking NFTs and into NFT Projects
In a way, the previous example is a form of staking, however there are other protocols that have staking pools for NFTSs. There are a couple options available to us here. We can enter into staking pools with our crypto, or if appropriate with our NFTs. What is quite often the case in these situations is you are then given an erc20 token that represents your share of the pool (much lie we have in the DAO itself). We can then trade that token on the market if we wish or hold it and collect yield from the pool.

Often times we will also find NFT projects and games that have crypto staking pools, with their own token matched up to ethereum or USDT or whatever. They often pay very high interest rates, so that is another possibility to explore.

### Burning NFTs
Say what? Yeah it's true. Burning NFTs is a great way to increase the value of other NFTs you hold. For example, the project could whale into a projects NFT drops and purchase a large chunk of the drop (or buy up all the remaining copies after an initial drop). For a large enough purchase, the DAO could even negotiate with the project, a price to bulk purchase. After the NFTCD owns the NFTs, the community may vote to burn a percentage of them and be left with more valuable NFTs, for every person who purchased one, even if they are not members of the NFTCD.

### What else can we do with the DAO?
This is not a question that can be easily answered as the direction of the DAO will evolve over time, based on the community interests. Some options that can be looked at is:

Becoming governance partners in other projects, through the purchase of a projects governance token or by earning them through other means.
Partnerships with other DAO's
Entering into the DAO of DAO's, called "UberDao" on the DAOHaus system
grant programs to bootstrap developing projects or in very special cases, individual creators who are active members of the DAO.

### Can I quit my day job if I join the DAO?
I wouldn't do that just yet, but hopefully one day we can say that involvement in the DAO will be profitable enough to quit your day job.

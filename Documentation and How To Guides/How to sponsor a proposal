# How to sponser a proposal

* From the DAO's overview page, click on "View Proposals"

A list of all of the current proposals appear on the left column. The upper right hand corner of the "box" containing the proposal will tell you the current status of the proposal. If it says "unsponsered" then that proposal will need to be sponsered before a vote can take place on the proposal.

* Click anywhere in the proposals box that requires a sponser

On the proposal page on the right hand side you will see the sponser buttion. Above that is (circled) is the cost to sponser the proposal. This is returned to your wallet after the voting period ends, minus the reward given to the person who submits the final vote to the blockchain (this will be the topic of another tutorial) In this case, the price to sponser the proposal is 5WMATIC.

* Click the "Sponser" button
